Warning!
========

Disable Greasemonkey before clicking on the userscript name. Otherwise, you will be prompted to install it, but this is wrong â€” the full page source will be 'installed' instead of the real userscript.

If you really want to install a userscript from here, you should first disable Greasemonkey, click on the userscript, re-enable Greasemonkey, then click on the 'raw' link above the script source.
